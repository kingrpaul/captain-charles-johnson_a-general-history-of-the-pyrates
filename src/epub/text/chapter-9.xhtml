			<h2 epub:type="title">The Life of Anne Bonny</h2>
			<p>As we have been more particular in the lives of these two women, than those of other pirates, it is incumbent on us, as a faithful historian, to begin with their birth. Anne Bonny was born at a town near Cork, in the kingdom of Ireland, her father an attorney at law, but Anne was not one of his legitimate issue, which seems to cross an old Proverb, which says, that bastards have the best luck. Her father was a married man, and his wife having been brought to bed, contracted an illness in her lying in, and in order to recover her health, she was advised to remove for change of air; the place she chose, was a few miles distance from her dwelling, where her husband’s mother liv’d. Here she sojourn’d some time, her husband staying at home, to follow his affairs. The servant-maid, whom she left to look after the house, and attend the family, being a handsome young woman, was courted by a young man of the same Town, who was a tanner; this tanner used to take his opportunities, when the family was out of the way, of coming to pursue his courtship; and being with the Maid one day as she was employ’d in the household business, not having the fear of God before his eyes, he takes his opportunity, when her back was turned, of whipping three silver spoons into his pocket. The Maid soon miss’d the spoons, and knowing that nobody had been in the Room, but herself and the young man, since she saw them last, she charged him with taking them; he very stiffly denied it, upon which she grew outrageous, and threatened to go to a constable, in order to carry him before a Justice of Peace: these menaces frighten’d him out of his wits, well knowing he could not stand search; wherefore he endeavoured to pacify her, by desiring her to examine the drawers and other places, and perhaps she might find them; in this time he slips into another Room, where the Maid usually lay, and puts the spoons betwixt the sheets, and then makes his escape by a back door, concluding she must find them, when she went to bed, and so next day he might pretend he did it only to frighten her, and the thing might be laugh’d off for a jest.</p>
			<p>As soon as she miss’d him, she gave over her search, concluding he had carried them off, and went directly to the constable, in order to have him apprehended: the young man was informed, that a constable had been in search of him, but he regarded it but little, not doubting but all would be well next day. Three or four days passed, and still he was told, the constable was upon the hunt for him, this made him lye concealed, he could not comprehend the meaning of it, he imagined no less, than that the maid had a mind to convert the spoons to her own use, and put the robbery upon him.</p>
			<p>It happened, at this time, that the mistress being perfectly recovered of her late indisposition, was return’d home, in company with her mother-in-law; the first News she heard, was of the loss of the spoons, with the manner how; the Maid telling her, at the same time, that the young man was run away. The young fellow had intelligence of the Mistress’ arrival, and considering with himself, that he could never appear again in his business, unless this matter was got over, and she being a good natured woman, he took a resolution of going directly to her, and of telling her the whole story, only with this difference, that he did it for a jest.</p>
			<p>The mistress could scarce believe it, however, she went directly to the maid’s room, and turning down the bed clothes, there, to her great surprise, found the three spoons; upon this she desired the young man to go home and mind his business, for he should have no trouble about it.</p>
			<p>The mistress could not imagine the meaning of this, she never had found the maid guilty of any pilfering, and therefore it could not enter her head, that she designed to steal the spoons her self; upon the whole, she concluded the Maid had not been in her bed, from the time the spoons were miss’d, she grew immediately jealous upon it, and suspected, that the Maid supplied her place with her husband, during her absence, and this was the reason why the spoons were no sooner found.</p>
			<p>She call’d to mind several actions of kindness, her husband had showed the maid, things that pass’d unheeded by, when they happened, but now she had got that tormentor, jealousy, in her head, amounted to proofs of their intimacy; another circumstance which strengthen’d the whole, was, that tho’ her husband knew she was to come home that day, and had had no communication with her in four months, which was before her last Lying in, yet he took an opportunity of going out of town that morning, upon some slight pretence:⁠—all these things put together, confirm’d her in her jealousy.</p>
			<p>As women seldom forgive injuries of this kind, she thought of discharging her revenge upon the maid: in order to this, she leaves the spoons where she found them, and orders the Maid to put clean sheets upon the bed, telling her, she intended to lye there herself that night, because her mother in law was to lye in her bed, and that she (the Maid) must lye in another part of the house; the Maid in making the bed, was surprised with the Sight of the spoons, but there were very good reasons, why it was not proper for her to tell where she found them, therefore she takes them up, puts them in her trunk, intending to leave them in some place, where they might be found by chance.</p>
			<p>The mistress, that every thing might look to be done without design, lies that night in the maid’s bed, little dreaming of what an adventure it would produce: after she had been abed some time, thinking on what had pass’d, for jealousy kept her awake, she heard somebody enter the Room; at first she apprehended it to be thieves, and was so fright’ned, she had not courage enough to call out; but when she heard these words, Mary, are you awake? She knew it to be her husband’s voice; then her fright was over, yet she made no answer, least he should find her out, if she spoke, therefore she resolved to counterfeit sleep, and take what followed.</p>
			<p>The husband came to bed, and that night play’d the vigorous lover; but one thing spoil’d the diversion on the wife’s side, which was, the reflection that it was not design’d for her; however she was very passive, and bore it like a Christian. Early before day, she stole out of bed, leaving him asleep, and went to her mother in law, telling her what had passed, not forgetting how he had used her, as taking her for the Maid; the husband also stole out, not thinking it convenient to be catch’d in that room; in the meantime, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Revenge</i> of the Mistress was strongly against the Maid, and without considering, that to her she ow’d the diversion of the night before, and that one good turn should deserve another; she sent for a constable, and charged her with stealing the spoons: the Maid’s trunk was broke open, and the spoons found, upon which she was carried before a Justice of Peace, and by him committed to goal.</p>
			<p>The husband loiter’d about till <time datetime="12:00">twelve a clock at noon</time>, then comes home, pretended he was just come to town; as soon as he heard what had passed, in relation to the Maid, he fell into a great passion with his wife; this set the thing into a greater flame, the mother takes the wife’s part against her own son, insomuch that the quarrel increasing, the mother and wife took horse immediately, and went back to the mother’s house, and the husband and wife never bedded together after.</p>
			<p>The maid lay a long time in the prison, it being near half a year to the assizes; but before it happened, it was discovered she was with child; when she was arraign’d at the Bar, she was discharged for want of evidence; the wife’s conscience touch’d her, and as she did not believe the Maid guilty of any theft, except that of Love, she did not appear against her; soon after her acquittal, she was delivered of a girl.</p>
			<p>But what alarm’d the husband most, was, that it was discovered the wife was with child also, he taking it for granted, he had had no intimacy with her, since her last lying in, grew jealous of her, in his turn, and made this a handle to justify himself, for his usage of her, pretending now he had suspected her long, but that here was proof; she was delivered of twins, a boy and a girl.</p>
			<p>The mother fell ill, sent to her son to reconcile him to his wife, but he would not harken to it; therefore she made a will, leaving all she had in the hands of certain trustees, for the use of the wife and two children lately born, and died a few days after.</p>
			<p>This was an ugly turn upon him, his greatest dependence being upon his mother; however, his wife was kinder to him than he deserved, for she made him a yearly allowance out of what was left, tho’ they continued to live separate: it lasted near five years; at this time having a great affection for the girl he had by his Maid, he had a Mind to take it home, to live with him; but as all the Town knew it to be a girl, the better to disguise the matter from them, as well as from his wife, he had it put into breeches, as a boy, pretending it was a relation’s child he was to breed up to be his clerk.</p>
			<p>The wife heard he had a little boy at home he was very fond of, but as she did not know any relation of his that had such a child, she employ’d a friend to enquire further into it; this person by talking with the child, found it to be a girl, discovered that the servant-maid was its mother, and that the husband still kept up his correspondence with her.</p>
			<p>Upon this intelligence, the wife being unwilling that her children’s money should go towards the maintenance of bastards, stopped the allowance: the husband enraged, in a kind of revenge, takes the Maid home, and lives with her publicly, to the great scandal of his neighbours; but he soon found the bad effect of it, for by degrees lost his practice, so that he saw plainly he could not live there, therefore he thought of removing, and turning what effects he had into ready money; he goes to Cork, and there with his maid and daughter embarks for Carolina.</p>
			<p>At first he followed the practice of the law in that province, but afterwards fell into merchandise, which proved more successful to him, for he gained by it sufficient to purchase a considerable plantation: his Maid, who passed for his wife, happened to dye, after which his daughter, our Anne Bonny, now grown up, kept his house.</p>
			<p>She was of a fierce and courageous temper, wherefore, when she lay under condemnation, several stories were reported of her, much to her disadvantage, as that she had kill’d an English servant-maid once in her passion with a case-Knife, while she look’d after her father’s house; but upon further enquiry, I found this story to be groundless: it was certain she was so robust, that once, when a young fellow would have lain with her, against her Will, she beat him so, that he lay ill of it a considerable time.</p>
			<p>While she lived with her father, she was look’d upon as one that would be a good fortune, wherefore it was thought her father expected a good match for her; but she spoilt all, for without his consent, she marries a young fellow, who belonged to the sea, and was not worth a Groat; which provoked her father to such a degree, that he turned her out of doors, upon which the young fellow, who married her, finding himself disappointed in his expectation, shipped himself and wife, for the Island of Providence, expecting employment there.</p>
			<p>Here she became acquainted with Rackam the pirate, who making courtship to her, soon found Means of withdrawing her affections from her husband, so that she consented to elope from him, and go to sea with Rackam in men’s clothes: she was as good as her word, and after she had been at sea some time, she proved with child, and beginning to grow big, Rackam landed her on the Island of Cuba; and recommending her there to some friends of his, they took care of her, till she was brought to bed: when she was up and well again, he sent for her to bear him company.</p>
			<p>The King’s Proclamation being out, for pardoning of pirates, he took the benefit of it, and surrendered; afterwards being sent upon the privateering account, he returned to his old trade, as has been already hinted in the story of Mary Read. In all these expeditions, Anne Bonny bore him company, and when any business was to be done in their way, nobody was more forward or courageous than she, and particularly when they were taken; she and Mary Read, with one more, were all the persons that durst keep the deck, as has been before hinted.</p>
			<p>Her father was known to a great many gentlemen, planters of Jamaica, who had dealt with him, and among whom he had a good reputation; and some of them, who had been in Carolina, remember’d to have seen her in his house; wherefore they were inclined to show her favour, but the action of leaving her husband was an ugly circumstance against her. The day that Rackam was executed, by special favour, he was admitted to see her; but all the comfort she gave him, was, that she was sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hang’d like a dog.</p>
			<p>She was continued in prison, to the time of her lying in, and afterwards reprieved from time to time; but what is become of her since, we cannot tell; only this we know, that she was not executed.</p>
